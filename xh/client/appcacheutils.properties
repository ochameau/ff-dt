# LOCALIZATION NOTE These strings are used inside the Web Console

# These messages are displayed when an attempt is made to validate a

# The correct localization of this file might be to keep it in

# You want to make that choice consistent across the developer tools.
# A good criteria is the language in which you'd find the best

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (notUTF8): the associated cache manifest has a character
# encoding that is not UTF-8. Parameters: %S is the current encoding.

# the same URI from multiple locations. Parameters: %1$S is the URI, %2$S is a
# list of references to this URI.
duplicateURI=URI %1$S walathiswe kwiindawo ezininzi. Oku akuvumelekanga: %2$S.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (networkBlocksURI, fallbackBlocksURI): the associated
# cache manifest references the same URI in the NETWORK (or FALLBACK) section
# as it does in other sections. Parameters: %1$S is the line number, %2$S is
# the resource name, %3$S is the line number, %4$S is the resource name, %5$S
# is the section name.
networkBlocksURI=Umgca wecandelo leNETHIWEKHI %1$S (%2$S) uthintela i-caching yomgca %3$S (%4$S) kwi %5$S candelo.
fallbackBlocksURI=Umgca wecandelo le-FALLBACK %1$S (%2$S) ithintela i-caching yomgca %3$S (%4$S) kwi %5$S candelo.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (fileChangedButNotManifest): the associated cache manifest
# references a URI that has a file modified after the cache manifest.
# Parameters: %1$S is the resource name, %2$S is the cache manifest, %3$S is
# the line number.
fileChangedButNotManifest=Ifiyile %1$S yayilungiswe emva %2$S. Ngaphandle kokuba isiqendu kwifayile ye-manifest itshintshe inguqulelo e-cached iza kusetyenziswa endaweni yokuba isemgceni %3$S.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (cacheControlNoStore): the specified page has a header
# preventing caching or storing information. Parameters: %1$S is the resource
# name, %2$S is the line number.
cacheControlNoStore=%1$S ineseti ye-cache-control ukuya kwi-no-store. Oku kuza kuthintela i-cache ye-aplikheshini ekubeni igcine ifayile emgceni %2$S.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (notAvailable): the specified resource is not available.
# Parameters: %1$S is the resource name, %2$S is the line number.
notAvailable=%1$S yolatha kwisixhobo esingekho emgceni we-%2$S.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (invalidURI): it's used when an invalid URI is passed to
# the appcache.
invalidURI=I-URI egqithele kwi-AppCacheUtils iyasebenza.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (noResults): it's used when a search returns no results.
noResults=Ukhangelo lwakh alubuyisanga ziphumo.\u0020

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (cacheDisabled): it's used when the cache is disabled and
# an attempt is made to view offline data.
cacheDisabled=I-cache ye-disk yakho yenzie ayasebenza. Nceda usete ibhrawuza.cache.disk.enable to true in about:config kwaye uzame kwakhona.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (firstLineMustBeCacheManifest): the associated cache
# manifest has a first line that is not "CACHE MANIFEST". Parameters: %S is
# the line number.
firstLineMustBeCacheManifest=Umgca wokuqala we-manifest kufuneka ibengu "CACHE MANIFEST" kumgca %S.

# %1$S is the section name, %2$S is the line number.
asteriskInWrongSection2=Inkwenkwezana (*) isetyenziswe ngendlela engachanekanga %1$S kwicandelo kumgca %2$S. Ukuba umgca kwicandelo KWINETHIWEKHI uqulethe uphawu olunye lwenkwenkwezana, emva koko nayiphina i-URI engadweliswanga kwi-manifest iza kuthatha njengokuba i-URI ibidwelisiwe kwicandelo le-NETHIWEKHI. Kungenjalo i-URI enjalo iza kuthatha njengengekhoyo. Abanye abasebenzisi bophawu lwenkwenkwezana * bathintelwe.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (escapeSpaces): the associated cache manifest has a space
# in a URI. Spaces must be replaced with %20. Parameters: %S is the line

escapeSpaces=Izithuba kwi-URIs kufuneka indawo yazo ithathwe yi-%20 kwimigca %S.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (slashDotDotSlashBad): the associated cache manifest has a
# URI containing /../, which is invalid. Parameters: %S is the line number
# where this error occurs.
slashDotDotSlashBad=/../ ayisosimaphambili se-URI kumgca %S.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (tooManyDotDotSlashes): the associated cache manifest has
# a URI containing too many ../ operators. Too many of these operators mean
# that the file would be below the root of the site, which is not possible.
# Parameters: %S is the line number where this error occurs.
