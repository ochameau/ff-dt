# LOCALIZATION NOTE These strings are used inside the Web Console
# command line which is available from the Web Developer sub-menu
# -> 'Web Console'.
# The correct localization of this file might be to keep it in
# English, or another language commonly spoken among web developers.
# You want to make that choice consistent across the developer tools.
# A good criteria is the language in which you'd find the best
# documentation on web development on the web.

# For each command there are in general two strings. As an example consider
# the 'pref' command.
# commandDesc (e.g. prefDesc for the command 'pref'): this string contains a
# very short description of the command. It's designed to be shown in a menu
# alongside the command name, which is why it should be as short as possible.
# commandManual (e.g. prefManual for the command 'pref'): this string will
# contain a fuller description of the command. It's diplayed when the user
# asks for help about a specific command (e.g. 'help pref').

# LOCALIZATION NOTE: This message is used to describe any command or command
# parameter when no description has been provided.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE: The default name for a group of parameters.
